        "\n",
        "So what does that \"stateful\" mean?\n",
        "\n",
        "To put it simply - we want to have some kind of object which we can pass around our application that holds information about what the current situation (state) is. Since our system will be constructed of many parts moving in a coordinated fashion - we want to be able to ensure we have some commonly understood idea of that state.\n",
        "\n",
        "LangGraph leverages a `StatefulGraph` which uses an `AgentState` object to pass information between the various nodes of the graph.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are more options than what we'll see below - but this `AgentState` object is one that is stored in a `TypedDict` with the key `messages` and the value is a `Sequence` of `BaseMessages` that will be appended to whenever the state changes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's think about a simple example to help understand exactly what this means (we'll simplify a great deal to try and clearly communicate what state is doing):\n",
        "\n",
        "1. We initialize our state object:\n",
        "  - `{\"messages\" : []}`\n",
        "2. Our user submits a query to our application.\n",
        "  - New State: `HumanMessage(#1)`\n",
        "  - `{\"messages\" : [HumanMessage(#1)}`\n",
        "3. We pass our state object to an Agent node which is able to read the current state. It will use the last `HumanMessage` as input. It gets some kind of output which it will add to the state.\n",
        "  - New State: `AgentMessage(#1, additional_kwargs {\"function_call\" : \"WebSearchTool\"})`\n",
        "  - `{\"messages\" : [HumanMessage(#1), AgentMessage(#1, ...)]}`\n",
        "4. We pass our state object to a \"conditional node\" (more on this later) which reads the last state to determine if we need to use a tool - which it can determine properly because of our provided object!"

        "\n",
        "1. Is there any specific limit to how many times we can cycle?\n",
        "- There is no inherent limit to the number of cycles within the LangGraph system.\n",
        "- The system's design allows for potentially infinite loops unless explicitly constrained. This flexibility is part of what makes LangGraph suitable for complex agent workflows that may require multiple cycles to reach a conclusion.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. How could we impose a limit on the number of cycles?\n",
        "\n",
        "The LangGraph system allows for implementing cycle limits through conditions in the state management. Here are two ways to impose such limits:\n",
        "\n",
        "a) You can use a condition within your function to check the number of cycles or messages. For example, in the check_helpfulness function, you can implement a cycle limit by checking the length of the state object:\n",
        "\n",
        "``` python\n",
        "def check_helpfulness(state):\n",
        "    if len(state[\"messages\"]) > 10:\n",
        "        return \"END\"\n",
        "    # ... rest of the function\n",
        "``` \n",
        "\n",
        "This approach checks the number of messages and terminates the cycle if it exceeds 10.\n",
        "\n",
        "b) By adding a condition that checks the number of iterations, you can force the agent to exit if a certain threshold is reached. This ensures that the agent will eventually terminate its process even if it hasn't reached a satisfactory conclusion through its normal decision-making process."

            "\n",
            "Agent Response: RAG, or Retrieval-Augmented Generation, is a technique used in the context of Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance their performance by combining retrieval-based methods with generative models. The core idea is to augment the generative capabilities of LLMs with relevant information retrieved from a large corpus of documents or a knowledge base. This approach helps in generating more accurate and contextually relevant responses, especially for tasks that require specific knowledge or up-to-date information.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Key Components of RAG:\n",
            "1. **Retriever**: This component searches a large corpus to find relevant documents or passages based on the input query.\n",
            "2. **Generator**: This component generates the final response by conditioning on both the input query and the retrieved documents.\n",

            "1. **Query Input**: The user provides a query or prompt.\n",

            "- **Improved Accuracy**: By leveraging external knowledge, RAG can provide more accurate and detailed responses.\n",

              "\"RAG stands for Retrieval-Augmented Generation. It is a technique used in natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning to improve the performance of language models by combining retrieval-based methods with generative models. Here's a brief overview of how it works:\\n\\n1. **Retrieval**: In the first step, the system retrieves relevant documents or pieces of information from a large corpus based on the input query. This is typically done using a retrieval model, such as BM25 or a dense retrieval model like DPR (Dense Passage Retrieval).\\n\\n2. **Augmentation**: The retrieved documents are then used to augment the input query. This means that the information from the retrieved documents is combined with the original query to provide more context and relevant information.\\n\\n3. **Generation**: Finally, a generative model, such as a transformer-based language model (e.g., GPT-3, BERT), uses the augmented input to generate a response. The generative model can produce more accurate and contextually relevant answers because it has access to additional information from the retrieval step.\\n\\nRAG is particularly useful in scenarios where the model needs to generate responses based on a large and diverse set of information, such as in open-domain question answering, customer support, and knowledge-based systems. By leveraging both retrieval and generation, RAG can provide more accurate and informative responses compared to using either approach alone.\""

              "   'output': 'LoRA, or Low-Rank Adaptation, is a technique used in the field of machine learning, particularly in the context of fine-tuning large language models. Here are some significant improvements that LoRA brings:\\n\\n1. **Parameter Efficiency**: LoRA significantly reduces the number of trainable parameters required for fine-tuning. Instead of updating all the parameters of a large pre-trained model, LoRA introduces a small number of additional parameters that capture the necessary adaptations. This makes the fine-tuning process more efficient and less resource-intensive.\\n\\n2. **Memory Efficiency**: By reducing the number of parameters that need to be updated, LoRA also reduces the memory footprint during training. This is particularly beneficial when working with very large models that would otherwise require substantial computational resources.\\n\\n3. **Faster Training**: With fewer parameters to update, the training process becomes faster. This allows for quicker iterations and experimentation, which is valuable in research and development settings.\\n\\n4. **Improved Generalization**: LoRA can help in achieving better generalization by focusing on low-rank adaptations. This can lead to models that perform better on unseen data, as the fine-tuning process is more targeted and less prone to overfitting.\\n\\n5. **Modularity**: LoRA allows for modular adaptations, meaning that different low-rank adaptations can be combined or swapped in and out as needed. This modularity can be useful for creating specialized models for different tasks without needing to retrain the entire model from scratch.\\n\\n6. **Scalability**: LoRA is scalable to very large models, making it a practical approach for fine-tuning state-of-the-art language models that have billions of parameters.\\n\\n7. **Cost-Effectiveness**: By reducing the computational and memory requirements, LoRA makes the fine-tuning process more cost-effective. This is particularly important for organizations with limited resources.\\n\\nOverall, LoRA provides a more efficient and effective way to fine-tune large language models, making it a valuable technique in the field of machine learning.',\n",
